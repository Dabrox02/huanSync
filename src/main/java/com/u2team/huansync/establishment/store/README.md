# TRADE - STORE 

In the present Readme, the attributes of the conceptual model, logical model, and physical model are established, in addition to having the default class model for managing classes and backend code in Java.

## Conceptual Model 

Based on the specific requirements of the system, we have the management of cash registers along with stores, aiming to facilitate sales of various items in the requested convention. Each store will feature unique products in its inventory, and it will also handle those items that fulfill specific requests from buyers. The cash registers will have three states: active, inactive, and in the case of order transactions, there will be three states: registered, paid, and delivered.
Additionally, we will oversee a product inventory, managing its specifications and categorizing them by product types. All of these components are designed to optimize the sales process and ensure a seamless experience for buyers.
